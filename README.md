## Motivation

I created this repository for two main reasons:

1. **Learning GitHub Project Management:** One of the primary motivations behind creating this repository was to gain a better understanding of how to create and manage my own GitHub projects. By setting up this repository, I have learned valuable skills such as organizing code, collaborating with others, managing issues, and maintaining a version-controlled project.

2. **Advent of Code Puzzles:** I am a big fan of the yearly Advent of Code puzzles. They offer exciting coding challenges and keep me engaged throughout the Advent season. Creating this repository was a way for me to participate in the Advent of Code challenges, showcase my coding skills, and share my solutions with others.

I hope you find this repository helpful and enjoy exploring the solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles as much as I enjoyed solving them.
